# Background & Motivation
## Teachers & Student Success
- A teacher's quality can greatly influence students' academic outcomes.
- Characteristics such as having an advanced degree or more years of teaching experience may contribute to higher-quality teaching.
- Additionally, schools may perform better overall if they can maintain high rates of teacher retention, as teacher turnover can negatively impact students.

## Texas Education Service Center 20
- We draw from public, school district-level data in one of Texas' 20 education regions (ESC Region 20), which has 58 districts.
- The most urban part of this region is San Antonio, Texas (population: 1.5 million), but there are extremely rural parts as well, in addition to counties that border Mexico.
- This region provides diverse insights into the relatonship between teacher characteristics and student outcomes in a wide range of contexts.

## How does teacher experience level affect test scores?
In these plots, each data point represents a school district.
We can see that there is a positive correlation between teacher years of experience and percentage of student meeting grade level benchmarks on both math and reading STAAR tests, the most prominent standardized test in Texas for grades 3-12.

display(HTML(f'<img src="{image_path}" alt="Your Image" width="500" height="300">'))
```


## How do different degree types affect math test scores?
As you can see, there is no clear correlation between types of degree and proficiency on math test scores. Teachers who have a Master's degree appear to have no advantage over teachers with simply a Bachelor's degree.
```{python}
image_path = "/Users/evylanai/Documents/GitHub/python_final_project/degrees_math_scatter.png"
display(HTML(f'<img src="{image_path}" alt="Your Image" width="500" height="300">'))
```

## How do different degree types affect reading test scores?
This proves true for reading test scores as well, underlining the idea that teacher experience, rather than advanced degree, is most indicative of a high-quality teacher.
```{python}
image_path = "/Users/evylanai/Documents/GitHub/python_final_project/degrees_ELA_scatter.png"
display(HTML(f'<img src="{image_path}" alt="Your Image" width="500" height="300">'))
```


## Is it important for teachers to have a degree at all?
However, it is important to note that districts with more teachers *without any degree* tend to produce lower test score averages. Although this represents only a small percentage of districts in the region, it provides support for the idea that a college degree is indicative of high-level teaching.
```{python}
image_path = "/Users/evylanai/Documents/GitHub/python_final_project/nodegree_STAAR_scatter.png"
display(HTML(f'<img src="{image_path}" alt="Your Image" width="500" height="300">'))
```
